    bio: "I have experience in diverse technologies at both startups and big tech companies. In 2021, I revamped MARSfarm's client website using React, MongoDB, and Express, adding features like remote control, Google oAuth2, data entry, and dynamic visualizations with Chart.js. This led to a 40% price increase for their units. In 2022, I interned at Amazon, working on big data processing with Hadoop and EMR. I developed a tool that accelerated data querying by 100x and allowed more specific search criteria. This was my first experience with big data processing.",
